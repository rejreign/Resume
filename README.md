#### SCRIPTING WEBPAGES USING HTML ONLY, CREATIVITY WITH TABLES; *NO STYLE, JAVASCRIPT OR CSS*

	Scripting a web page using only HTML can be quite challenging
    Even more challenging is any attempt to infuse a bit of creativity
	to an arrangement of just text. 
	
	However, taking a cue from the hint(**table**) given, it was quite helpful in transforming a rather
	bland page to something suitably eye-catching.
