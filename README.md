#### SCRIPTING WEBPAGES USING HTML & CSS ONLY; _NO TABLES, NO JAVASCRIPT OR FRAMEWORKS_

#####	 Scripting a web page using only HTML can be quite challenging
#####    Even more challenging is any attempt to infuse a bit of creativity
#####	 to an arrangement of just text and images.
	
#####	 However, using __Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)__, the page is easily styled. 
#####    Here are a few changes to the code:

- [x]	 The page is divided into 2 columns using div and an outer "wrap". A design of nav bars have been placed 
		 and styled, colored, positioned and bordered differently to allow body color show

- [x]	 Having been advised to discard table, the <hr> tag was used to create the 
- [x]	 horizontal lines separating the sections of text on column one.

- [x]    Body background color, border(style & width) - as well as 
- [x]    a section of Column 2 including font(changed to white), have been reviewed.

- [x] 	 Font color of all anchor texts have been changed to blue(both as is and when visited), for aesthetics reasons.

- [x]	 An anchor __hover__ feature has been effected on only the quote on text:  __"Patrick McKenzie(@patio11)"__
- [x]	 Thus, font size should popout having been coded to increase by 105% when mouse is hovered on it.
- [x]	 However, for all anchor tags, font color should be purple when mouse is hovered on it.

- [x]	 IDs and Classes were used as required. CSS code was written separately and linked to the HTML code in <Head>
