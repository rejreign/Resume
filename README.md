#### SCRIPTING WEBPAGES USING HTML & CSS ONLY; _NO TABLES, NO JAVASCRIPT OR FRAMEWORKS_

#####	 Scripting a web page using only HTML can be quite challenging
#####    Even more challenging is any attempt to infuse a bit of creativity
#####	 to an arrangement of just text and images.
	
#####	 However, using __Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)__, the page is easily styled. 
#####    Here are a few changes to the code:

- [x]	 __1__. Page is divided into 2 columns using __div__ and __nav__ tags
- [x]	 __2__. The  __hr__ tag was used to create horizontal line spacing for sections of column 1.
- [x]    __3__.  A review of __body__ ; column 2's __section__ & __font-color__ (changed to White) was effected
- [x] 	 __4__. __font-color__  of all __a__ texts have been changed to blue(both as is and when visited), for aesthetics reasons.

- [x]	 An __a__:__hover__ feature has been effected on only the quote on text:  __"Patrick McKenzie(@patio11)"__
- [x]	 _Thus, font size should popout having been coded to increase by 105% when mouse is hovered on it.
- [x]	 However, for all anchor tags, font color should be purple when mouse is hovered on it.

- [x]	 IDs and Classes were used as required. CSS code was written separately and linked to the HTML code in <Head>
